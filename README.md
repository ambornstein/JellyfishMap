# Aquarium Review Map
A project created to host reviews of aquariums all over the US. Each aquarium can have multiple reviews including overall quality rating and jellyfish exhibit rating, as well as a gallery of user-uploaded photos. The reviews are only posted with permission but available to be viewed publicly by anyone. This site implements a custom JWT authentication mechanism without using any auth frameworks. This can be found in the server code.
